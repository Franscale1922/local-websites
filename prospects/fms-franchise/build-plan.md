## SEO Architecture

- **Root layout title template:** `'%s | FMS Franchise Marketing Systems'`
- **Interactive pages** (ROI Calculator, Readiness Assessment): metadata in sibling `layout.tsx`
- **Redirect pages**: no metadata (correct — redirects don't need it)
- **All content pages**: unique `export const metadata` with title + description
- **Total pages with metadata:** ~65 unique content pages + dynamic blog template

## Route Alias / Redirect Map

| Incoming URL | Redirects To | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/about` | `/about-us` | Legacy duplicate |
| `/about-us/blog` | `/blog` | Canonical URL consolidation |
| `/learn/faqs` | `/learn/faq` | URL normalization |
| `/learn/industry-facts` | `/learn/franchise-industry-facts` | URL normalization |
| `/learn/why-franchising` | `/learn/why-franchise` | URL normalization |
| `/learn/resources/state-guidelines` | `/learn/state-guidelines` | URL normalization |
| `/learn/resources/franchising-guidelines` | `/learn/resources` | URL normalization |
| `/services/franchise-business-plans` | `/services/franchise-business-plan` | URL normalization |
| `/services/marketing-your-franchise` | `/services` | No standalone parent page |
| `/industries/home-based-franchises` | `/industries/home-based` | URL normalization |

## Video Registry

| # | Page | Embed Type | YouTube ID / File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Homepage Hero | YouTube | `SWM3XFxTNcs` — Chris Conner intro |
| 2 | Homepage Process | YouTube | `uLh_iITjQ6Q` — Step-by-step process |
| 3 | Homepage Testimonial | YouTube | `E7AY_KrqePA` — MF Gyros |
| 4 | Homepage Testimonial | YouTube | `Y_OkkRZGOAo` — Bagel Hole |
| 5 | Homepage Testimonial | YouTube | `GmiHv1yDbLw` — Green Home Solutions |
| 6 | About Us | YouTube | `2JgdVcRwv18` — Team Introduction |
| 7 | About Us | Local MP4 | `/public/about-2.mp4` — ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL COPY |

**Action required:** Copy `About 2.mp4` from `/Users/kelseystuart/local-websites/About 2.mp4` to `/Users/kelseystuart/local-websites/prospects/fms-franchise/site/public/about-2.mp4`

## Design System

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary Green (dark) | `#2c4a2e` / `#1a3a1c` |
| Secondary Green (mid) | `#4a7c59` |
| Gold / Accent | `#c8a84b` |
| Background Off-white | `#f8f8f6` |
| Text Dark | `#1a3a1c` |
| Text Mid | `#555` |
| Heading Font | Montserrat (Google Fonts) |
| Body Font | Source Sans 3 (Google Fonts) |

All styles are **inline** — no Tailwind, no CSS modules. Every hover effect uses `onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave`. 'use client' pages that need metadata use a sibling `layout.tsx`.
